My first website using basic HTML, CSS, and JS to allow users to input a name and number to interact with the website. There are three pages which you can navigate to with the buttons located at the bottom. The last page feature a simple minigame which is based on randomization. If either you or the enemy rolls a 6, then it's a lose.
